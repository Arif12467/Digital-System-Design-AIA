This Test modified the original project in Test-4 to utilize the LED Decoder to show the sound level.
This is done in [leddec.vhd] (./leddec.vhd) where the file compares the input data value and displays a number to show how loud the sound is at the moment.
The test was never compiled in Vivado due to Vivado having an error creating files.
