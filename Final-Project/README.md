## Required Hardware
* Pmod I2S
* Speaker with 3.5 mm connector
* Nexys A7-100T

## Inspiration for Project
These Youtube videos from GreatScott! were the inspiration behind this project. The Automatic Volume Adjuster gave me the idea to make a device to allow the user to have a safe listening volume. The Garage Alarm System gave me the inspiration for the trigger component of the system. I also love his catchphase "Stay Creative, and I will see you next Time!"
